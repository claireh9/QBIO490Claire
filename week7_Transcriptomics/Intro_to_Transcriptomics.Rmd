***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on Brightspace.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In SummarizedExperiment Tutorial, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure and turn it into more readable dataframes, saving them as rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes. In this semi-guided assignment, you will use these dataframes to perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in 490_cluster.
```{r setup}
 knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("/home1/heclaire/490_cluster/analysis_data")) 
```

If DESeq2 is not already installed, install it now
```{r}
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
library(DESeq2)
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")
library(EnhancedVolcano)
```

Load in all necessary packages
```{r}
library(BiocManager)
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(maftools)

rna_query <- GDCquery(project ="TCGA-BRCA",
                      data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
                      data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
                      workflow.type = "STAR - Counts")

rna_se <- GDCprepare(rna_query)
```


*1*
Read in the rna_clinical, rna_genes, and rna_counts dataframes which you made in the "SummarizedExperiment Guided Tutorial" R Notebook

```{r}
rna_clinical<-rna_se@colData
rna_clinical<- as.data.frame(rna_clinical)
rna_genes<- rna_se@rowRanges@elementMetadata
rna_genes<- as.data.frame(rna_genes)
rna_counts<- rna_se@assays@data$unstranded
rna_counts<-as.data.frame(rna_counts)

rownames(rna_genes)<-rna_genes$gene_id
rownames(rna_counts)<-rownames(rna_genes)
colnames(rna_counts)<-rownames(rna_clinical)
```

```{r}
write.csv(rna_clinical, "brca_rna_clinical_data.csv", row.names = TRUE)
write.csv(rna_genes, "brca_rna_gene_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(rna_counts, "brca_rna_count_data.csv", row.names = TRUE)

```

```{r}
rna_clinical <- read.csv("/home1/heclaire/490_cluster/analysis_data/brca_rna_clinical_data.csv", row.names = 1)
rna_genes<-read.csv("/home1/heclaire/490_cluster/analysis_data/brca_rna_gene_data.csv")
rna_counts<-read.csv("/home1/heclaire/490_cluster/analysis_data/brca_rna_count_data.csv", row.names = 1)
```


*2*
In this assignment, you will run differential expression analysis comparing patient samples by whether the sample is from a tumor or normal tissue (this is the definition column in rna_clinical). You will need to choose a variable to control for covariance of: age and/or PAM50 subtype (paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50). 

Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?) Filter out genes with a total expression across all patients less than 1000.
```{r}
no_na_mask<-!is.na(rna_clinical$definition) & !is.na(rna_clinical$age_at_index)
clean_clinical<-rna_clinical[no_na_mask,]

no_solid_tissue_normal_mask<- ifelse(clean_clinical$sample_type=="Solid Tissue Normal",F,T)
clean_clinical<- clean_clinical[no_solid_tissue_normal_mask,]

clean_count<- rna_counts[ ,no_na_mask]
clean_count<- clean_count[ ,no_solid_tissue_normal_mask]

less_100_mask<-rowSums(clean_count)>=100
clean_count<-clean_count[less_100_mask,]
clean_genes<- rna_genes[less_100_mask,]

```


*3*
Perform the differential expression analysis, All you need to do is fill in the appropriate # terms
```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = clean_count,
                              colData = clean_clinical,
                              design= ~age_at_index+definition)

dds_obj <- DESeq(dds)

resultsNames(dds_obj)

results <- results(dds_obj, format = "DataFrame", contrast = c("definition","Primary solid Tumor","Metastatic"))

results <- data.frame(results)
```

Prepare results dataframe for EnhancedVolcano plotting. Add two columns, "-log10(padj)" and "gene_name". Fill in these columns appropriately.
```{r}
results$gene_name<-clean_genes$gene_name
```

*4*
Now we will use the EnhancedVolcano package to plot our results. The code is already completed and should run without adjustment if all code up to here is correct.

```{r}
png("volcanoplot2.png",width = 1000, height = 500)


EnhancedVolcano(results,
                lab = results$gene_name,
                x = 'log2FoldChange',
                y = 'padj',
                title = 'Sample Definition: Tumor vs Metastatic',
                pointSize = 1.0,
                labSize = 5.0)
```

# Explain what genes from each part of the Volcano Plot mean in terms of their significance and up/down regulation. 
top-right genes: Those genes are significantly up regulated
bottom-right genes: Those genes are not significantly up regulated
top-left genes: Those genes are significantly down regulated
bottom-left genes: Those genes are not significantly down regulated
top-middle genes: Those genes show no significant change in expression between the two groups but have significant p values
bottom-middle genes: Those genes show no significant change in expression between the two groups and doesn't have significant p values

Save the picture of the volcano plot (using either ggsave() or right clicking and manually downloading the image and push this .Rmd and the image to GitHub)
